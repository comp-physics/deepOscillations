> This work demonstrates the existence of a FLOP-efficient integrators for one-dimensional oscillatory integrals. The simple feed-forward architecture efficiently calculates oscillatory integrals with high precision and low computational cost compared to current numerical integration methods. The presented method holds applicability where numerical integrals of a one-dimensional oscillating functions are required either as an end-to-end problem or a sub-problem
