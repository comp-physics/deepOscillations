> Traditional numerical methods for calculating oscillatory integrals often compromise between precision and computational efficiency. This repository introduces a groundbreaking approach, EfficientIntegrator-NN, that leverages the power of machine learning to revolutionize this space. Our unique method trains a neural network model on various instances of an oscillatory function, enabling it to learn and predict the integral values with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.
